# Architect — Multidisciplinary Idea & Project Evaluator

Assess any idea or existing project from multiple angles simultaneously. Dispatches specialist evaluators in parallel, each analyzing from their domain, then synthesizes their outputs into a unified evaluation.

## How It Works

1. **Mode Detection** — auto-detects if input is a new idea or an existing project (by path reference)
2. **Classification** — identifies type: Software / Business / Educational / Social / Creative
3. **Evaluator Selection** — picks 3-6 evaluators based on type:
   - **Risk Assessor**: always included
   - **Technical Architect**: auto-included for software
   - **Market Analyst**: auto-included for revenue-generating ideas
   - **Impact Evaluator**: for social/educational/community ideas
   - **Resource Strategist**: when resource constraints matter
   - **Innovation Scout**: when differentiation or competition are relevant
4. **Parallel Dispatch** — launches evaluators simultaneously using agent files in `agents/`
5. **Synthesis** — `agents/synthesizer.md` resolves conflicts, calculates scores, produces unified output

## Output

- **Opportunity Score** (1-10) with justification
- **Value Matrix**: Commercial / Educational / Social / Technical Feasibility / Risk Level / Resource Efficiency
- **Risk Assessment**: Critical / Significant / Monitoring items + Go/No-Go recommendation
- **Key Synergies**: actions that serve multiple dimensions
- **Prioritized Next Steps**: max 7 focused actions

For existing projects, also includes Project Health Score and Course Corrections.

## Usage

```
"Evaluate my idea: a CLI that generates test suites from codebase analysis"
"Assess the project at ./my-startup — is it worth continuing?"
"Score this concept: marketplace for AI agent skills"
```

## Quick Mode

Use `commands/architect-quick.md` for faster evaluation with only 3 evaluators and no synthesizer agent.

## Setup

After installing, fill in `data/context.md` with your:
- Primary interests and domains
- Technical skills and resources
- Risk tolerance
- Evaluation dimension priorities

This personalizes all evaluations to your context.

## Bilingual

All evaluators respond in the same language you write in. Spanish or English — detected automatically.
